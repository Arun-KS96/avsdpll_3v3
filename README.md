# On-chip clock multiplier (PLL) 
**(Fclkin—5MHz to 12MHz, Fclkout—40MHZ to 100MHZ at 1.8v)**
This repository contains simulation files and other relevant files on the On-chip clock multiplier (PLL) (Fclkin—5MHz to 12MHz, Fclkout—40MHZ to 100MHZ at 1.8v)IP worked on in the VSD Online Internship - Batch 2 in collaboration with SCL India.
